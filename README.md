## Intro

  This is a miniturization of the original colecovision. All logic is simplified to a single CPLD.

## SOURCES
### Schematic Check
  - Atari HQ Schematic : https://wiki.console5.com/wiki/Colecovision : Dan Boris

## REQUIREMENTS
  - KiCAD v7.X
  - Quartus v13.0.1sp1 web edition
  - Altera USB Blaster

## BUILD TIPS
  This design is made so anyone can build this. Though it will need a board from a PCB manufacture due to the small pitch and
  vias. There are only a few SMD devices, the CPU, a cap, and a few resistors. These are larger to help make soldering easier.

  Recommend populating the SMD parts first, then moving on to the through hole parts from passive to active. If you do not plan
  on using a battery pack the shotkey diodes can be omitted.
