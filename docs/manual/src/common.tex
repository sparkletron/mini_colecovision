\section{Introduction}

\par
Mini Colecovision is a portable console version of the original Colecovision. Much of the TTL and Analog Monostable circuits
are emulated by a CPLD. The full PCB and CPLD code is in this repository. It emulates the original Colecovision
with the additional super game module. No 3D printed case is included at the moment, but has been designed and tested. This
manual is not at step by step document of how to build the unit, more of a highlight of aspects of the project.

\section{Building}

\par
This document assumes some Electrical Engineering knowledge. Building circuits is not
trivial due to the mix of SMD and through hole components. What follow are general
steps to build the Mini Colecovision

\begin{itemize}
  \item Create main PCB from schematic/gerber/coleco\_original.zip
  \item Create Right Angle PCB from schematic/gerber/right\_angle/right\_angle.zip
  \item Program ROM with BIOS
  \item Populate main PCB
  \item Populate right angle PCB
  \item Power up and program CPLD
  \item Build your own case
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies}

\par
The following are the dependencies needed to build the firmware and PCB for the system.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Quartus 13.0 sp1
  \item python 3.X
  \item KiCAD v7.X
\end{itemize}

\input{src/fusesoc/files_fusesoc.tex}

\subsubsection{Fusesoc}
\input{src/fusesoc/targets_fusesoc.tex}

\par
Fusesoc is used for the simulation target only. There are no build targets due to the use of Quartus 13.0sp1.
This makes the use of it a bit silly. It does make it easier to use in future projects where the RAM,ROM,CPU,VDP,
and Sound chips are also IP cores.

\subsubsection{Quartus}
\par
This project uses the last version of Quartus that supports the MAX7000S series. The version is 13.0sp1.
The project is located at src/quartus13sp01/. Once you have the project open please follow the softwares steps
for building and programming the CPLD bitfile.

\subsection{PCB}

\par
The four layer PCB is fairly easy to populate. The right angle PCB is a dual layer PCB which is even easier.
I recommend starting with resistors, then IC's, and then the rest. Surface mount parts should be done last.
This is a fairly complex project to build, take great caution in making sure your CPU and CPLD are installed
correctly. Its easy to rotate square packages these come in.

\subsection{3D Printed Case}

\par
A 3D printed case model is not included. I've kept this for release in the future.

\subsection{Programming}

\par
There are two devices that need to be programmed. ROM (read only memory) and the CPLD (complex programmable logic device).
They use two different methods to be programmed. The ROM is done off the board and then installed. The CPLD is installed
and the JTAG header is used to upload the bitfile.

\subsubsection{ROM}

\par
A TL866 is an excellent device for programming the ROM with a BIOS. The open source minipro application works well with it and
its clones. Below is a example command to use to program the ROM with a bios.

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ minipro -p ST27C256 -w coleco_bios.bin
  \end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{CPLD}

\par
Quartus 13.0sp1 is the easiest way to build and program the MAX7000 CPLD. You will need an altera blaster.
I recommend the chinese clone blasters, they actually worked the best. While the worst was the Terasic blaster
which did not work at all. As for instructions on how to program it in Quartus, please see the software for details.
